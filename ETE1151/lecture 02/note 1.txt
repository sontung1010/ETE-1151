The first task for everyone learning a program is to get the machine to print on the screen. 

Below is a complete program in C.

main()
{
	printf("hellow class\n");
}

Start Visual Studio 
File->New->Project 

main()
Every program has a function main where execution begins. The parenthesis following main indicates to the compiler that it is a function.


{
A left { begins the body of each function. A corresponding right brace } must end the function.

printf()
C system contains a standard library of functions that ca be used in the programs. This function prints to the screen "hello class\n"

"hello class\n" is an argument to the function.

The two charactor \n (read backslash n) represent a single character. It is a non printing character. Its effect is to advance the cursor on the screen to
a new line 

printf("hello");
printf("class");
printf("\n");

The above three lines is equivalent to the previous printf statement.

Our goal is to print to screen 
hello "class"

The following code will not work 
printf("hello "class"\n");

To print " we need to type \"

Other escape characters

\t	(horizontal tab)

\\	print single backslash 
\"	print single "
\'	print single '
\a	alert. sound system bell 

What is the exact putput of the following code
printf("my\nname\is\nnot\nJohn\n");
