Variables, Expression and Assignment Statements

Variables are used to store values

We have different kind of variables that store different kind of data.

Let's write small program to create some variables and do simple calculations. 

Start Visual Studio in 2019 (use Console App)

See 02 variables expressions

The variables inches, feet are declared to be of type int. 
int is on the fundamental types in C.
Variable type int can take on integer values 

The declarations tell the compiler what kind of data can be stored in each variable. 

Other variable types, character data, floating data (real numbers)

The compiler uses this information to be able to set aside appropriate amount of memory to hold the data. 

Variable name also called an identifier consists of sequence of letters, digits and underscore, but may not begin with a digit. 

2feet is not a valid identifier. It has to start with a letter, not with a digit.

Technically you can start a variable with underscore _, but we will not do this in this class. 

Certain reserved words, called keywords cannot be used by the programmer as name of variable. 

Keywords: char, int, floating

feet = 3; 
This is an assignment statement. The equal sign = is the basic assignment operator. The value of te expression on the right sode of = symbol is assigned to
the variable on the left side.

inches = feet * 12;
tihs is also an assignment statement. feet * 12 is calculated and the value is calculated and the value is assigned to inches. 

* is a multiplication operator 
+ is an addition operator 
- is a substraction operator 
/ is a division operator 
% is a modulus operator

3 / 2 = 1 (when you do integer division)
2 / 0 (division by 0 is not allowed, the system will crash)

5 % 3 = 2 (remainder when 5 is divided by 3) 
modulus operator only used on integer data. 

printf("    %d feet\n", feet);
The printf has two arguments 
"     %d feet\n"
feet

The first argument in a printf function is always a string, called the control string 

The control string contains the conversion expression also called format expression %d

The format expression %d causes the value of the expression in the second argument to be printed in a format of decimal integer.

======================================================================================================================================================
The keyword char stands for a character.
variables and constants of type char are used to manipulated character.

constants of type char are written within single quotes as in 'A', '1', '+'
