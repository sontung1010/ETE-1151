For Loops used to repeat bunch code 

counter-controlled loop repetition structure 
1) have a control variable referred to as loop counter 
2) define initial value of the control variable
3) continuation statement that tests the final value of the control variable 
4) increment or decrement the control variable 

for (define and initialize variable ; condition ; increment/decrement) {
	body of code 
}

those 3 things in the for loop are all optional

for (cnt = 10; cnt < 20; cnt += 4) {
	cout << (cnt + 1) << "\n";
	cout << (cnt + 2) << "\n";
}
